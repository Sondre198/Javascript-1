My website is a online store where gamers can buy video games online. I took inspiration from other online video game stores like Steam and Epic Games store.



I didn't change much from my initial prototype. Some things are different only because I had a hard til with coding it to look exactly like the prototype.

I also made the website responsive with mobile devices

to make the checkout page I used a tutorial on W3Schools
